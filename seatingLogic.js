//HAWT Dawna
//10 booths which seat 6
//10 tables in the Resteraunt each table seats 4.
// if we combine a table to seat 8 we now have 9 tables but same amount(40) people allowed + 60 ppl booths
//allowing 100 guests

//if all seats are taken then inject "partyName" and "partySize"

/* 
The user form should
Ask them *partySize *partyTime *contactPhone *contactEmail *Special notes or allergies

ONLY VARIABLES THAT MATTER ARE *partySize & *partyTime
Does the resteraunt have enough seating during the time requested? if yes then give them the reservation and subtract the partySize
from the available seating total for that time.

if no seats available at that time then do not show the option to choose. but offer 20 minutes before/after.
if 4 reservations for a certain time then we should subtract (tableSize * amountOfpartys) from the total seats available.
**Either only show available times or 
if time has already occured than it is not available.
